# Testing Pyramid

Tests are typically broken into three different kinds:
- [[Unit Tests]]
- [[Integration Tests]]
- [[UI Tests]]

The testing pyramid is concept originally explained by Mike Cohn in his book _Succeeding with Agile_. The testing pyramid gives you a way to group different types of tests and gives an understanding of how many tests you should consider on each layer.

You should have lots of small **unit tests**, some **integration** and fewer **UI tests**.
