# Testing

A test is a procedure used to evaluate if a method, an entire class, a module or even a whole application behaves correctly.

You should write tests to have confidence when refactoring.

Tests also act as complementary documentation of the application features.

The tests you write should be short, simple to read and easy to follow.

You should only write tests related to the logic of your application (not 3rd party libraries).

You can use test coverage tools to find untested code that should be tested.

## Distributing the tests

A typical rule of thumb is to have the following ratio among the categories:
_(According to Google in its testing fundamentals documentation)_

-   **UI Tests:** 10%
    
-   **Integration Tests:** 20%
    
-   **Unit Tests:** 70%

## [[Testing Pyramid]]
Tests are typically broken into three different kinds:
- [[Unit Tests]]
- [[Integration Tests]]
- [[UI Tests]]


##  [[Test-Driven-Development]] (TDD)

## [[Behavioral-Driven-Development]] (BDD)

[[Quality Assurance]]

[[Test Coverage]]
