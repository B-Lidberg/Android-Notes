# Ktor

### Kotlin and Coroutines
Ktor is built from the ground up using [[Kotlin]] and [[Coroutines]]. You get to use a concise, multiplatform language, as well as the power of asynchronous programming with an intuitive imperative flow.

### Lightweight and Flexible
Ktor allows you to use only what you need, and to structure your application the way you need it. In addition you can also extend Ktor with your own plugin very easily.
