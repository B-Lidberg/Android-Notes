## What is [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)? 

Obsidian is a powerful **knowledge base** on top of  
a **local folder** of plain text Markdown files. 

Allows for backlinks and hashtags for quick/ease of access to help tie resources and information together with ease! 

Theres also a graph view for a great visualization seeing how everything connects! 

Here is a great YouTube Playlist to get started with [**Obsidian**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88&list=RDCMUC85D7ERwhke7wVqskV_DZUA&index=1)
