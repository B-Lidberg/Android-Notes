# GitHub

 Github is a web-based interface that uses [[Git]], the open source [[version control]] software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time.
 
 GitHub can be accessed from the Web, an IDE, Desktop App, and even through a mobile app.

## Common terms:
-   **Repository (repo)** — a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored.
-   **Branch** — a workspace in which you can make changes that won’t affect the live site.
-   **Markdown (.md)** — a way to write in Github that converts plain text to GitHub code.
-   **Commit Changes** — a saved record of a change made to a file within the repo.
-   **Pull Request (PR)** — the way to ask for changes made to a branch to be merged into another branch that also allows for multiple users to see, discuss and review work being done.
-   **Merge** — after a pull request is approved, the commit will be pulled in (or merged) from one branch to another and then, deployed on the live site
-   **Issues** — how work is tracked when using git. Issues allow users to report new tasks and content fixes, as well as allows users to track progress on a project board from beginning to end of a specific project.
