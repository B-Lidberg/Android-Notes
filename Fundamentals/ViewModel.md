# ViewModel

A **[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)** object provides the data for a specific UI component, such as a fragment or activity, and contains data-handling business logic to communicate with the model. For example, the `ViewModel` can call other components to load the data, and it can forward user requests to modify the data. The `ViewModel` doesn't know about UI components, so it isn't affected by configuration changes, such as recreating an activity when rotating the device.
