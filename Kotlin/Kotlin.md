# Kotlin Programming Language #reference

  
Kotlin is a cross-platform, [[statically typed]], general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with [[Java]], and the [[JVM]] version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but [[type inference]] allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript or native code; e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps.

Google adopted Kotlin as an official language for Android Development and is the language for [[Jetpack Compose]] (not able to use Java as it makes heavy use of Kotlin features such as [[coroutines]] & a [[Kotlin compiler]] plugin)
